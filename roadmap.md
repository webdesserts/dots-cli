# Dots

## Interface
- `dots install`
    - should install & link all dependencies
- `dots doctor`
    - should check to see if all files & links are in place without taking any action
- `dots outdated`
    - should check (to the best of its ability) if any of the bins are outdated
- `dots remove`
    -should cleanly remove all dotfiles

## Responsibilities
- should link `.bash_profile` & `.bashrc`
- should run a set of  `git config` commands
- should pull down velvet and run its install script
- should pull down brew and run brew Bundle

## Questions
Is there a way I can externalize things like `.aws` and `.vix`?
How would `dots doctor` work with `git config`?

Maybe should be a Map of some sort that accepts 3 functions:

1. install
2. check
3. remove

Maybe also should list dependent installs so that things donâ€™t try to install until their dependencies have installed?

## Install Process

1. download to `./config/dots/.tmp/`
2. read `Dots.toml` package name
3. rename to `./config/dots/{name}/`
4. link everything
5. write name => repo in `./config/dots/manifest.toml`
